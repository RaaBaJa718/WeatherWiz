WeatherWiz is a full-stack weather dashboard application that allows users to search for a city and view the current weather and 5-day forecast. The app also keeps a history of searched cities, which can be deleted individually. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, and the frontend uses Vite and TypeScript.
